          <h2>About Rebecca Tarbotton</h2>
          <p>
            Rebecca Tarbotton, known to friends as Becky, was a profound thinker and leader. She was dedicated to merging environmental and social justice movements towards transformational changes in forest protection, climate change and human rights. A self-proclaimed “pragmatic idealist,” Becky was deeply admired by a whole movement of activists for her boldness and clarity of vision.
          </p>

          <blockquote>
            We don't always know exactly what it is that creates social change. It takes everything from science all the way to faith, and it's that fertile place right in the middle where really exceptional campaigning happens - and that is where I strive to be.
          </blockquote>

          <p>

            In 2010, at the age of 38??, Becky became the first female executive director of the US based Rainforest Action Network (RAN) in its 27 year history. Under her leadership, RAN achieved tremendous victories in preserving endangered rainforests and the rights of their indigenous inhabitants. She helped to architect the most significant agreement in the history of the organization: a landmark policy by Disney Entertainment that redefined how the company purchases and uses paper in order to protect endangered rainforests. Prior to becoming Executive Director, Becky led RAN's Global Finance Campaign against some of the nation’s most powerful private financial institutions to successfully negotiate a sector-wide bank policy statement known as the Carbon Principles. The policy put limits on the financing of new coal-fired power plants, which created a pivotal moment in the battle to curtail the construction of 200 planned new coal plants in the US. In her first years at RAN, she helped lead an effort to persuade major banks, including Bank of America and Wells Fargo, to stop lending money to companies that mine coal by removing the tops of mountain in Appalachia.
          </p>
          <p>
            Becky spent much of her time thinking about how to inspire masses of people to work for transformational social and environmental change, and how to push and reform the continent’s biggest corporate polluters. As she said during a keynote address in October 2012:
          </p>

          <blockquote>

            "We need to remember that the work of our time is bigger than climate change. We need to be setting our sights higher and deeper. What we're really talking about, if we're honest with ourselves, is transforming everything about the way we live on this planet.

          </blockquote>

          <p>
            Becky was a regular panelist at international and human rights conferences and published numerous articles on her areas of expertise. She was a regular contributor to The Huffington Post and other major media outlets, and has been a fellow at the Oakland Institute, a BankTrack committee member, as well as an alumni of the Rockwood Leadership Institute and winner of the UK-based Derek Cooper Award for Investigative and Campaigning Journalism.

            Becky began her career doing research on indigenous communities on Baffin Island, in the far northern Canadian territory of Nunavut. Subsequently, she spent eight years working under Helena Norberg-Hodge at the International Society for Ecology and Culture (ISEC), which included running programs in Ladakh, India and later working in their UK and US offices promoting local alternatives to economic globalization. She referred to her years at ISEC as the period "where the roots of my activism are". One of her proudest achievements during this period was helping build a local women farmer’s alliance from a membership of seven women to a whopping 4,000 members.
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            Working with those women, helping them build alternatives to the western development model that was being imposed on their communities, was a foundational experience for me. It showed me that local wisdom is a powerful tool for change and that true solutions, when grounded in deep respect for cultural traditions, ecological wisdom and creativity can both improve quality of life and build a future where people live in harmony with nature.
